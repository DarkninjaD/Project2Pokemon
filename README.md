## User Stories:

- [ ] As a user, I want there to be a landing page at the / page that displays the message ‚ÄúWelcome to the world of Pokemon!‚Äù where I can click to enter.
- [ ] As a user, i want to be directed to the /forest page that will take me to a pokemon forest by default when I enter
- [ ] As a user, I want to see a few options of different regions (town, forest, gym, beach) that I can be redirect to so I can see pokemon in that region
- [ ] As a user, I should see a button that brings up a pokedex with pokemon names that I have had yet to see, with the image of a question mark beside them
- [ ] As a user, when I visit a region, I should be redirected to a page with /_region name_ and see a background image that corresponds with the type of region I‚Äôm visiting.
- [ ] As a user, if I visit a pokemon region, I should see 3-5 pokemon whose types correspond with the region
      As a user, if I click on a pokemon, I should be able to add it to my pokedex so I can now see its icon and click to view pokemon details within the pokedex
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to navigate between regions using tabs at the top of the page, above the image of the region
- [ ] As a user, I should see a pokemon logo at the top of each page so I know that I‚Äôm playing Pokemon and put me in the mood to catch them all
- [ ] As a pokemon master, I should see a toolbar at the bottom of my screen that will have pokedex, and catch feature.

## Planning (region, types):

- [ ] Forest Region: Grass, Bug, Flying, Poison, Fairy?
